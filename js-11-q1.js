// ? Question-1 :Using an example, explain the difference between block,global and function scope in variables.
// !example:
console.log("okay so block scope is the place between {\"curly braces\"}.\nif we code here inside a curly braces we said this code are inside a block scope.\nafunction scopes are same as block scope.\nso the only difference between block scope and function scope is that they named by function.\nglobal scope is what ever we write outside a block or function scope\ndifference?\nwe can access to variables that we define in global scope but this would not happen in function or block scope(P.S:var is available everey where.");
